# Difference-in-Difference-Outcome-Analysis
This project involved analysing the outcome of SDR projects which involves facilities in Kakamega Western Kenya. We used 3 facilities that are our treatment group (where implementation is being conducted) and 4 control groups from the same county. We looked at neonatal and maternal related indicators from MOH_711 from pre and post periods.
